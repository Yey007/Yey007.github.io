        Hello! My name is Utku Melemetci. I'm a programmer and a filmmaker, though
        I'm much more the former than the latter. This is pretty obvious if you compare
        the lengths of the software and film pages :)
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        I've been programming for about seven years now. At the start, I was interested
        in game dev, but that didn't really work out. Though I enjoyed the programming,
        doing everything else felt more like a chore, so I dropped it before I even
        made my first game.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        But I didn't stop programming. I did some small projects in C# and eventually
        branched out into other languages and other fields, like web dev and robotics.
        Check out the software page if you want to learn more about what I've done.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        As for filmmaking, I think I was initially inspired by
        <a class="clickable text-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChFur_NwVSbUozOcF_F2kMg">Mumbo Jumbo</a>,
        which is kind of funny. I wanted to create a film similar to <i>The Deal,</i> which
        I found very funny and well made. Unfortunately, once I wrote the script I
        kind of realized it sucked and dropped it.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        I'm not gonna say my next one, <i>Worth The Risk,</i> was amazing but it was better.
        I actually ended up filming this one, and you can check it out on the film page.
        Later on, I wrote another script called <i>Ruby and Lace,</i> which I think was actually
        alright. But the logistics for actually filming it are complicated and I won't have
        nearly the amount of support I did with <i>Worth The Risk,</i> so I probably won't
        ever film it. I may still upload the script some day.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        On the topic of film, I also ran the film club at my high school. We've done a couple
        of projects, which were all fun to work on.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        So, that's me, pretty much. If you have any questions or just want to talk, you can

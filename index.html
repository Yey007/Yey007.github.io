                Hello! My name is Utku Melemetci. I'm an ameture programmer and filmmaker. <br>
                And when I mean ameture, I really mean ameture. I'm sure the software and film pages <br>
                will make that obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been programming for a couple of years now. When I started, my intention <br>
                was actually to make games. However, with time, I found that I couldn't stay <br>
                motivated long enough to work on something like a game, as it involved many different <br>
                skills, some of which I was not interested in. So, before even finishing I game, <br>
                I gave up on game dev.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I didn't quit programming. I kept doing simple projects in the language <br>
                I knew best, C#. Eventually, what started as a small passion became raging fire <br>
                that now consumes most of my time, which is both a good and bad thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last year, I joined my school's robotics club. The language of choice was Java, <br>
                which obviously wasn't a difficult switch. I feel that it is there where I advanced <br>
                the most in terms of general programming skills. The people in the club were very <br>
                helpful an I learned a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Towards the end of that year, I started making my first open source contributions, <br>
                mainly to the ILGPU repository which you can read more about <a class="clickable text-link" href="software.html#ilgpu">here</a>. The community<br>
                there was also really helpful, and I'm super greatful for having found that library.<br>
                And well, that's where I am now, working on some personal projects and contributing<br>
                to others' projects as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for filmmaking, that started around a year and a half ago, I think. I remember <br>
                being inspired by <a class="clickable text-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ThatMumboJumbo2">Mumbo Jumbo</a>,
                a popular minecraft YouTuber but also filmmaker. <br>
                I watched his short film, "The Deal", and really liked the idea. I wanted to make <br>
                something like it, so I came up with a skit with two burgalers, robbing a house, <br>
                but one of the was an ameture and always made the worst descisions. I only got haflway <br>
                through before giving up.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in due time, I had another idea. This time, I was inspired by a book I had <br>
                read, called Refugee. I guess my film, Worth-The-Risk was suppossed to be about someone <br>
                with the same background, someone from a war torn country suffering every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote and produced the film with the help of a relative who helped me a lot during <br>
                shooting and production. In the end, I think it turned out alright. It definetly wasn't <br>
                anything with the actors, because they were amazing, but I don't think my writing did <br>
                the subject justice. I certainly hope to do better in the future. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                So, that's me pretty much. Well, the part that matter to this website at least. <br>
                If you have any questions, you can contact me through one of the methods listed <br>
                in the contacts page. I don't know if I can help, but I can try. Thanks for reading!

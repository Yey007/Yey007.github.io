        Hello! My name is Utku Melemetci. I'm an amateur programmer and filmmaker.
        And when I mean amateur, I really mean amateur. I'm sure the software and film pages
        will make that obvious.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        I have been programming for a couple of years now. When I started, my intention
        was actually to make games. However, with time, I found that I couldn't stay
        motivated long enough to work on something like a game, as it involved many different
        skills, some of which I was not interested in. So, before even finishing I game,
        I gave up on game dev.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        However, I didn't quit programming. I kept doing simple projects in the language
        I knew best, C#. Eventually, what started as a small passion became raging fire
        that now consumes most of my time, which is both a good and bad thing.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        Last year, I joined my school's robotics club. The language of choice was Java,
        which obviously wasn't a difficult switch. I feel that it is there where I advanced
        the most in terms of general programming skills. The people in the club were very
        helpful an I learned a lot.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        Towards the end of that year, I started making my first open source contributions,
        mainly to the ILGPU repository which you can read more about <a class="clickable text-link"
          href="software.html#ilgpu">here</a>. The community
        there was also really helpful, and I'm super grateful for having found that library.
        And well, that's where I am now, working on some personal projects and contributing
        to others' projects as well.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        As for filmmaking, that started around a year and a half ago, I think. I remember
        being inspired by <a class="clickable text-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ThatMumboJumbo2">Mumbo
          Jumbo</a>,
        a popular minecraft YouTuber but also filmmaker.
        I watched his short film, "The Deal", and really liked the idea. I wanted to make
        something like it, so I came up with a skit with two burglars, robbing a house,
        but one of the was an amateur and always made the worst decisions. I only got halfway
        through before giving up.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        However, in due time, I had another idea. This time, I was inspired by a book I had
        read, called Refugee. I guess my film, Worth-The-Risk was supposed to be about someone
        with the same background, someone from a war torn country suffering every day.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        I wrote and produced the film with the help of a relative who helped me a lot during
        shooting and production. In the end, I think it turned out alright. It definitely wasn't
        anything with the actors, because they were amazing, but I don't think my writing did
        the subject justice. I certainly hope to do better in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="fadeable">
        So, that's me pretty much. Well, the part that matter to this website at least.
        If you have any questions, you can contact me through one of the methods listed
        in the contacts page. I don't know if I can help, but I can try. Thanks for reading!

              This one's still in the works, but I'm trying to motorize a camera slider
              that I own. So far it's more of a mechanical engineering project than a
              software project, but eventually I'm going to have to figure out motion
              profiling or some other control theory to get the slider to move autonomously.
              Later down the line, I also plan on building an app to control it!

          Another work-in-progress. Basically, I'm trying to build a very simple computer with
          my own architecture in Minecraft. So far, I've come up with the architecture,
          built an emulator for it in Rust, and built the clock and a couple interactions
          of the ROM module. I'm currently working on compacting the ROM and building the RAM.

                class="clickable text-link">research paper</a>
              I wrote on scoring FIRST Tech Challenge games using computer vision. It
              doesn't quite work, but it does do a few things like detecting the field
              and tracking larger game elements well. You can read the paper if you want
              to know more about the program's strengths and weaknesses. I don't know
              if I'll ever come back to improve it, but I hope it can serve as a good base
              for future development.

          TranscriberBot is a Discord bot written in TypeScript that uses the IBM
          Watson Speech-to-Text API to provide live transcription of voice channels.
          My biggest learning from this project wasn't really how to use Discord.js
          or Watson, but rather how to set up CI/CD. I built a full pipeline using
          GitHub Actions and Docker deploying to my old laptop. It can even
          run integration tests by launching another bot and testing that interactions
          work correctly.

          I'm the Director of Technology for a non-profit organization called the
          Youth Passion Project (YPP), which offers free, online courses to kids grades 1-8
          taught by high schoolers. I teach once in a while, but my primary role at
          the Project is to develop and maintain the
          <a class="clickable text-link" href="https://ypp-portal-prod.web.app/">new web portal</a>. The portal is
          designed to streamline interactions between Project administration, instructors,
          students, and their parents by providing a single platform for everything YPP.
        </p>
        <p class="fadeable">
          The portal is built with client-side React and Firebase. In hindsight,
          the choice of Firebase (and especially Firestore) is slightly questionable as the data is highly relational,
          but the portal had to be extremely cheap to run and there weren't many free
          options out there. Client-rendered React was chosen for a similar reason.
        </p>
        <p class="fadeable">
          Being on a larger project for almost three years working with lots of people
          has taught me a lot. I learned how to better set deadlines and stick to them,
          how to mitigate (or live with?) technical debt and legacy code,
          and how to incorporate feedback from actual users. Of course, I also learned
          about building web apps, automated testing, etc.From a technical and
          non-technical standpoint, my time at YPP has been extremely valuable
          to my growth as a developer.

          ILGPU is a .NET library that allows developers to write GPU accelerated code
          without resorting to low-level APIs like OpenCL or CUDA. I have
          only contributed a little to this library, but I wanted to include it here as
          it's a very cool project and the developers are very kind and welcoming. I encourage everyone
          to check it out and contribute! Read more about it in the

ILGPU is a .NET library that allows developers to write GPU
accelerated code without resorting to low-level APIs like OpenCL or
CUDA. I have only contributed a little to this library, but I wanted
to include it here as it's a very cool project and the developers
are very kind and welcoming. I encourage everyone to check it out
and contribute! Read more about it in the [README](https://github.com/m4rs-mt/ILGPU#readme)

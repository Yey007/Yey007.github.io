ILGPU is a .NET library that allows developers to write GPU
accelerated code without resorting to low-level APIs like OpenCL or
CUDA. I have contributed basic bug fixes and some quality-of-life
features. I'm currently working on a Roslyn analyzer to improve the
developer experience by highlighting potential runtime issues. I've
also laid the foundations for creating a new SPIR-V backend.

As a side note, I've found the ILGPU community to be incredibly
kind and welcoming. I encourage everyone to give the library a try!

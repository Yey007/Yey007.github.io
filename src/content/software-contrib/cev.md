I'm a member of the autonomy subteam of Cornell Electric Vehicles, where I work on autonomous algorithms for model- and full-scale electric cars. The team works on problems spanning the autonomy stack, from perception to planning and controls.

Recently, I have been working mostly on [iterative closest point (ICP)](https://github.com/cornellev/icp), which is a (class of) algorithms for aligning point clouds. ICP is important for LiDAR-based localization and mapping. The project has lent itself both to deep research and hacking together new ways to improve convergence, which is a dynamic I have enjoyed.

I have also worked on a variety of smaller programs, like odometry for our mini-cars and vision code to collapse depth data into a planner-friendly occupancy grid.

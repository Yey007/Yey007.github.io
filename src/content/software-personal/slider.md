I'm working towards automating my camera slider using a stepper motor and
an ESP32. By the end, the slider will be fully controllable through a web
interface served by the ESP32. The interface will facilitate the creation
of custom splines, which the slider will be able to execute.
So far, I have designed and 3D printed parts to mount the motor and belt.
I have also created a spline editor for the web interface and written an
initial prototype of the spline execution system.

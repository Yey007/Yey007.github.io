This one's still in the works, but I'm trying to motorize a camera
slider that I own. I'm using an Arduino and a stepper motor to move
the slider, and Bézier curves to generate smooth motion. To mount
the stepper motor, belt, and Arduino, I'm designing 3D parts using
Fusion 360. Finally, I'm also building a Flutter app to allow for
easy control.

What I love about this project is that it has pushed me to explore
areas I'm unfamiliar with and learn more. I hadn't properly worked
in embedded systems before this project, and that came with unique
performance challenges, like being unable to sample Bézier curves
fast enough at higher microsteps. This is the problem I'm currently
working on.

I also didn't have much CAD experience outside of the basics I
learned in a class. With the help of my friends, I got a lot better
at not only CAD but also mechanical and structural design.

Finally, every stage of this project has involved a lot of math.
From making torque calculations while choosing a motor, to deriving
the math for proper zooming for the app (painful), to understanding
Bézier curves, this project has pushed me to use more math in my
programming work. So far, it has taken me to amazing places, and I
will undoubtedly learn even more.

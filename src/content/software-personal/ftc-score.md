ftc-score is the product of a [research paper](https://github.com/Yey007/ftc-score/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf)
I wrote on scoring FIRST Tech Challenge games using computer vision.
It doesn't quite work, but it does do a few things like detecting
the field and tracking larger game elements well. You can read the
paper if you want to know more about the program's strengths and
weaknesses. I don't know if I'll ever come back to improve it, but I
hope it can serve as a good base for future development.

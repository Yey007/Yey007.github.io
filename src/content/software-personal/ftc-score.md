`ftc-score` is the product of a [research paper](https://github.com/Yey007/ftc-score/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf)
I wrote on scoring FIRST Tech Challenge games using computer vision.
While it can't produce a concrete score, it can pretty reliably detect and track
the playing field and important game elements under difficult conditions like
obstructions and distortion. You can read the paper if you want to know more about
the program's strengths and weaknesses.
I don't know if I'll ever come back to improve it, but I
hope it can serve as a good base for future development.

`computer-emulator` is an emulator written in Rust for my custom 4-bit computer
architechture. The architecture supports unsigned integer arithmetic, I/O,
and memory pages. I'm also working on a custom assembler to make writing programs
easier. I hope to one day build a working version in real-life or at least
some kind of logic simulator.

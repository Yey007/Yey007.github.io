Another work-in-progress. Basically, I'm trying to build a very
simple computer with my own architecture in Minecraft. So far, I've
come up with the architecture, built an emulator for it in Rust, and
built the clock and a couple interactions of the ROM module. I'm
currently working on compacting the ROM and building the RAM.

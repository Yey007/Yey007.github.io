I was a major contributor to my [CS 3110](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110) group's
final project: an optimizing compiler to x86 for our own language written in OCaml. I worked
on the intermediate representation generation, register allocation, bug fixes in emission,
and randomized property-based testing. I also created the continuous integration pipeline
and the language documentation.
